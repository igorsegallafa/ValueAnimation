# Value Animation
Make a value animation with keyframes and easing function.

## Dependencies
* Functional C++ STD Library
* Vector C++ STD Library

## Usage

### Including library ###
First of all, you will need to include this library into your project. For this, you just need to include "ValueAnimation.h" file.

### Updating Animation ###
Call the function Update(float timeElapsed) specifying the time elapsed since last frame (in milliseconds).

### Examples ###
```c++
auto valueAnimation = Delta3D::Math::ValueAnimation<int>();
valueAnimation.From( 0 ).To( 100 ).During( 500 ).Ease( Delta3D::Math::Easing::BounceIn ); //from 0 to 100 during 500ms using bounce in easing
valueAnimation.To( 200 ).During( 1000 ); //from 100 (last value) to 200 during 1000ms using linear easing (default)
valueAnimation.To( 300 ).During( 2000 ); //from 200 (last value) to 300 during 2000ms using linear easing (default)
```

```c++
auto valueAnimation = Delta3D::Math::ValueAnimation<float>();
valueAnimation.SetLoop( true ); //put animation in loop
valueAnimation.SetKeyFrame( 0.f, 0.f, Delta3D::Math::Easing::Linear ); //set keyframe on time 0.0ms with value 0.0
valueAnimation.SetKeyFrame( 1000.f, 10.f, Delta3D::Math::Easing::BackIn ); //set keyframe on time 1000ms with value 10.0 using back in easing
valueAnimation.SetKeyFrame( 3000.f, 35.f, Delta3D::Math::Easing::QuadOut ); //set keyframe on time 3000ms with value 35.0 using quadOut in easing
```

## Documentation
How the library is very simple, have not a documentation generated by Doxygen, but the code comments are already supported to do this.
